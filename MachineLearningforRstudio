#Surprisingly, GDPchange & Wage.total appear as not have strong statistical relationship with unemployment rate (p-value = 0.846487 & 0.075910, coresspondingnly)
#possible explanation:
#GDPchange: Australia's Government expenses (stimulus package) play a role to aid the labour market during pandemic; therefore, the level of expense should also take into consideration
#Wage.total: it might be affected by "Wage.WAustralia" - multicollinarity problem

#R-squared (0.3797) is extremely low; 
#To accept the prediction model, there is a requirement to improve R-squared to at least > 0.5
#Note: R-squared should be fluctuated regarding to the train & test datasets, which were generated randomly
#R-squared value < 0.3 this value is generally considered a None or Very weak effect size,
#R-squared value 0.3 < r < 0.5 this value is generally considered a weak or low effect size,
#R-squared value 0.5 <= r < 0.7 this value is generally considered a Moderate effect size,
#R-squared value r > 0.7 this value is generally considered strong effect size

#Adjusted R-squared was still pretty low (0.3546) ; adjusted R-squared could be a better indicator to look at. It'll be increase when useful variables are added to the model

#Moreover, all added variables related to State's salary are duplicated with Wage.total variable
#Wage.total plays crucial roles to the model
